        A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
        arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform
        generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a
        wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware,
        operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.
        This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together,
        such as a computer network or computer cluster.

        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple
        special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are
        factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose
        devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet,
        which links billions of other computers and users.

        Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the
        abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution,
        some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms.
        More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
        The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.

        The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,
        On Computable Numbers. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine"
        and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of
        computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing
        the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program,
        where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central
        concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central
        object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores,
        modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability
        equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

        Today, computers do jobs that used to be complicated much simpler. For example, you can write a letter
        in a word processor, edit it anytime, spell check, print copies, and send it to someone across the world
        in seconds. All these activities would have taken someone days, if not months, to do before. Also,
        these examples are a small fraction of what computers can do. The network connecting these computers has its
        own challenges. On the one hand, data transmission rates for both wired and wireless networks are increasing
        rapidly. Access to gigabit-per-second wired net sis already possible, although expensive,and will
        come progressively  cheaper. Small wireless networks,based on digital cellular telephone principles,
        currently offer data rates between two and 10 megabits per second over a range of a few hundred meters.
        Low-power wireless networks transmitting 250,000 bits per second to each station will eventually
        be available commercially.

        <span class="font-weight-normal">Hello, my name is Dima. I'm developer of this web-application.
            This app designed to give people knowledge about computer and its components : what is important
            to buy and what is not. In sections of my app you can check actual information about computer
            components, compare components by their price and characteristics and build web version of your
            personal computer. It will help everyone comfortably and effortlessly assess the situation in the market.
            On this <a href="https://github.com/defr0stt/Computer-components" class="link-dark">Github page</a> u
            can see all changes throughout the life of the project. My web-app allows you to help to increase count of
            computer components on my site using "Component constructor". When u construct new component it will be
            sent to my e-mail where I check the correctness of this data. In a positive case this component will be added
            to general list. So be active and this app will develop faster)</span>
